## CRUD film management system using OMDb API

CRUD is an acronym that comes from the world of computer programming and refers to the four functions that are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application: **create**, **read**, **update** and **delete**. Persistent storage refers to any data storage device that retains power after the device is powered off, such as a hard disk or a solid-state drive. In contrast, random access memory and internal caching are two examples of volatile memory - they contain data that will be erased when they lose power.

Organizations that keep track of customer data, accounts, payment information, health data, and other records require data storage hardware and applications that provide persistent storage. This data is typically organized into a database, which is simply an organized collection of data that may be viewed electronically. There are many types of databases: hierarchical databases, graph databases, and object-oriented databases to name a few. The most commonly implemented type of database is a **relational database**, which consists of data tabled in rows and columns and connected to other tables with complementary information by a system of keywords that includes **primary keys and foreign keys**.

The **CRUD** acronym identifies all of the major functions that are inherent to **relational databases** and the applications used to manage them, which include Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and others.
